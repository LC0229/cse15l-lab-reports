Part2
The most important thing I learned in this class is Vim,which helps me even in the environment without Wifi, I can still edit the file. Another thing is called git. I believe this will be an important 
tool in the furture for working and collaborating. Everyone can works together based on github and push it from terminal. The skills I learned from this class is really practical for my career in the future.
